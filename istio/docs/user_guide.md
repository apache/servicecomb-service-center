# User Guide
This instructions will lead you to getting start with using Servicecomb-service-center-istio

## 1. Install dependencies
This tool can be used both inside a k8s cluster and a standalone service running on a VM.

For both ways you have to install dependencies first.

### 1.1 Install Kubernetes Cluster
You can follow K8S [installation instruction](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/) to install a K8S cluster

### 1.2 Install Istio
Follow this [instruction](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/getting-started/) to install istio

**note: the instruction is just a show case of how to install and use istio, if you want to use it in production, you have to use a production ready installation profile**

### 1.3 Install Istio DNS
As any Servicecomb service center service will be translated to Serviceentry in K8S, while Kubernetes provides DNS resolution for Kubernetes Services out of the box, any custom ServiceEntrys will not be recognized. In addition to capturing application traffic, Istio can also capture DNS requests to improve the performance and usability of your mesh

Use the following command to install istio DNS:
```
cat <<EOF | istioctl install -y -f -
apiVersion: install.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: IstioOperator
spec:
  meshConfig:
    defaultConfig:
      proxyMetadata:
        # Enable basic DNS proxying
        ISTIO_META_DNS_CAPTURE: "true"
        # Enable automatic address allocation, optional
        ISTIO_META_DNS_AUTO_ALLOCATE: "true"
EOF
```
