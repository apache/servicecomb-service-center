Apache ServiceComb Service-Center is a Restful based service-registry that provides micro-services discovery and micro-service management. 
It is based on Open API format and provides features like service-discovery, 
fault-tolerance, dynamic routing, notify subscription and scalable by design. 
It has high performance cache design and separate entity management for micro-services and their instances. 
It provides out of box support for metrics and tracing. It has a web portal to manage the micro-services.  

# Components
- server: a http server which provide restful API
- scctl: CLI of server
- syncer: alpha feature. multiple cluster synchronization tool, designed for large microservice architectures

## Features
 - **[`Open API`](/docs/openapi/v4.yaml)**: API doc(Open API format) management for microservice
 - **Metadata**: Metadata management for both microservice and microservice instance
 - **Separated**: Separated microservice and microservice instance entity management
 - **Domains**: Logical multiple domains management
 - **[`Security`](https://service-center.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guides/rbac.html)**: Role base access control for service discovery
 - **Discovery**: Support query instance by criteria
 - **Subscribe**: Use web socket to notify client about instance change events
 - **[`Portal`](/ux)**: Awesome web portal
 - **Fault tolerance**: Multiple fault tolerance mechanism and design in the architecture
 - **Performance**: Performance/Caching design
 - **[`Metrics`](https://service-center.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guides/integration-grafana.html)**: Able to expose Prometheus metric API automatically, [see](/docs/user-guides/metrics.md)
